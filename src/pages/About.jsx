      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        When I have the opportunity to work on any form of art, I delight in integrating challenges and exploring new experiences and feel liberated. I love the idea of creating something new. I live passionately and embrace my emotions rather than hold them back. I have an artistic point of view on my life and live in the present moment. As an Interactive designer, I am creative, accurate, and responsible. In addition, Iâ€™ve learned that time management and scheduling are essential to be successful in my career. I always listen to my audience to understand their needs and try to coordinate myself with their rhythm.
